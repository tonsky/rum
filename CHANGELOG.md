## 0.10.0

A big cleanup/optmization/goodies release with a lot breaking changes. Read carefully!

- [ BREAKING ] `cursor` got renamed to `cursor-in`. New `cursor` method added that takes single key (as everywhere in Clojure)
- [ BREAKING ] `rum/mount` returns `nil` (because you [shouldn’t rely on return value of ReactDOM.render](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/4936))
- [ BREAKING ] `:transfer-state` is gone. All of component’s state is now transferred by default. If you still need to do something fancy on `componentWillReceiveProps`, new callback is called `:did-remount` callback
- [ BREAKING ] removed `cursored` and `cursored-watch` mixins. They felt too unnatural to use
- [ BREAKING ] removed `rum/with-props` (deprecated since 0.3.0). Use `rum/with-key` and `rum/with-ref` instead
- [ BREAKING ] server-side rendering no longer calls `:did-mount` (obviously, that was a mistake)
- [ BREAKING ] `:rum/id` is gone. If you need an unique id per component, allocate one in `:init` as store it in state under namespaced key

When upgrading to 0.10.0, check this migration checklist:

- Change all `rum/cursor` calls to `rum/cursor-in`
- Find all `:transfer-state` mixins.
  - If the only thing they were doing is something like `(fn [old new] (assoc new ::key (::key old)))`, just delete them.
  - If not, rename to `:did-remount`
- Check if you were using `rum/mount` return value. If yes, find another way to obtain component (e.g. via `ref`, `defcc` etc)
- Replace `rum/with-props` with `rum/with-key`, `rum/with-ref` or `:key-fn`
- Check that you weren’t relying on `:did-mount` in server-side rendering

Now for the good stuff:

- Cursors now support metadata, `alter-meta!` etc
- Cursors can be used from Clojure
- Added `:key-fn` to mixins. That function will be called before element creation, with same arguments as render fn, and its return value will be used as a key on that element
- Mixins can specify `:before-render` (triggered at `componentWillMount` and `componentWillUpdate`) and `:after-render` (`componentDidMount` and `componentDidUpdate`) callback
- Added `rum/ref` and `rum/ref-node` helpers, returning backing component and DOM node
- Some client-side API functions added to server version (`dom-node`, `unmount`, `request-render` etc). Their implementation just throws an exception. This is to help you write less conditional directives in e.g. `:did-mount` or `:will-unmount` mixins. They will never be called, but won’t stop code from compiling either.

And couple of optimizations:

- Rum now makes use of staless components (nothing for you to do, if your component is defined via `defc` with no mixins, it’ll be automatically compiled to stateless component)
- Rum will use React’s batched updates to perform rendering on `requestAnimationFrame` in a single chunk
- Streamlined internals of component construction, removed `render->mixin`, `args->state`, `element` and `ctor->class`

## 0.9.1

- Added `rum.core/derived-atom`, a function that let you build reactive chains and directed acyclic graphs of dependent atoms. E.g. you want `*c` to always contain a value of `*a` plus a value of `*b` and update whenever any of them changes
- Added `rum.core/dom-node` helper that takes state and finds corresponding top DOM node of a component. Can be called in mixins after initial render only
- Fixed compatibility of `with-key` on nil-returning component in server rendering (thx [Alexander Solovyov](https://github.com/piranha), [#73](https://github.com/tonsky/rum/pull/73))

## 0.9.0

- Better support for server-side rendering of SVG
- [ BREAKING ] Rum used to support multiple ways to specify attributes. You would expect that both `:allow-full-screen`, `:allowFullScreen` and `"allowFullScreen"` would be normalized to `allowfullscreen`. As a result, you have to face three problems:
  - how do I decide which variant to use?
  - how do I ensure consistency accross my team and our codebase?
  - find & replace become harder

Starting with 0.9.0, Rum will adopt “There’s Only One Way To Do It” policy. All attributes MUST be specified as kebab-cased keywords:

| Attribute            | What to use                                     | What not to use                                       |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| class                | `:class`                                        | ~~`:class-name`~~ ~~`:className`~~                    |
| for                  | `:for`                                          | ~~`:html-for`~~ ~~`:htmlFor`~~                        |
| unescaped innerHTML  | `:dangerouslySetInnerHTML { :__html { "..." }}` |                                                       |
| uncontrolled value   | `:default-value`                                | ~~`:defaultValue`~~                                   |
| uncontrolled checked | `:default-checked`                              | ~~`:defaultChecked`~~                                 |
| itemid, classid      | `:item-id`, `:class-id`                         | ~~`:itemID`~~ ~~`:itemId`~~ ~~`:itemid`~~             |
| xml:lang etc         | `:xml-lang`                                     | ~~`:xml/lang`~~ ~~`:xmlLang`~~ ~~`"xml:lang"`~~       |
| xlink:href etc       | `:xlink-href`                                   | ~~`:xlink/href`~~ ~~`:xlinkHref`~~ ~~`"xlink:href"`~~ |
| xmlns                | not supported                                   |                                                       |

To migrate to 0.9.0 from earlier versions, just do search-and-replace for non-standard variants and replace them with recommended ones.

## 0.8.4

## 0.8.1

- Retain `:arglists` metadata on vars defined by `rum/def*` macros (thx [aJchemist](https://github.com/aJchemist), [#60](https://github.com/tonsky/rum/pull/60))

## 0.8.0

- Migrated to React 15.0.1
- Optimized server-side rendering (~4× faster than Rum 0.7.0, ~2-3× faster than Hiccup 1.0.5)

## 0.7.0

- Server-side rendering via `rum/render-html` (thx [Alexander Solovyov](https://github.com/piranha))

## 0.6.0

- [ BREAKING ] Updated to [React 0.14.3](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/10/07/react-v0.14.html) (thx [Andrey Antukh](https://github.com/niwinz), [#53](https://github.com/tonsky/rum/pull/53))
